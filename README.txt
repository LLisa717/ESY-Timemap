Sprouting ESY, a data visualization with time map. 

Sprouting ESY is a data visualizatin of Edible School Yard expansion over the last 15 years. Twenty years ago, Alice Water was quoted in a local newspaper, claiming that the school she passed every day looked like no one cared about it. She started the Edible Schoolyard project, which starts gardens and build teaching kitchens in schools across United States to enrich curriculum and life of school community. After twenty years, Edible Schoolyard became an important teaching institution and model of edible education. ESY Berkeley has served over 7,000 students all the world.

This visualization shows the expansion and adoption of Edible Schoolyard model over the last 15 years. Data was kindly provided by the Edible Schoolyard. Incomplete data with no year adopted was neglected from the visualization. 

I built this visualization based on a javascript library timemap.js, https://code.google.com/p/timemap/.
